Another CMS using CodeIgniter. 

Why ?
------
This repository is a web projet collection. We use popular Classes and Libraries (both JS and PHP) to create a more powerful CMS based on CodeIgniter.
We are also inspired by existing CMS (for not wasting time reinventing the wheel) and use popular API such as Plugin API from WordPress.
This projet is a best collection of several solutions, brings out by contributors around the world, which love CI.
As you may see, this new generation of Tendoo-cms is using latest generation of CodeIgniter (V3).
